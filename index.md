## Description

Connect is a dual purpose library, aiding in both rapid development, and deployment of node servers. Connect "middleware" can be stacked to create a robust application within minutes. The _connect_ executable supports launching of both regular `net.Server`, and `connect.Server` instances.
 
The connect executable supplies _init.d_ friendly _start_, _stop_, and _restart_ commands, and accept a direct path to the module meant to be run, otherwise defaults to trying both _app.js_ and _server.js_ in the current working directory.

Also to check the status of a process you may use the _status_ command, which
checks if the process is running.

## Executable Options

## Supported Environment Variables

Currently the following environment variables may be set
via the `--ENV VAL` catchall. For example we can alter the log
format used via the command line with `connect --logFormat ":method :uri".

Boolean values may use strings such as _yes_, _no_, _true_, _false_.

    --logFormat STR           Custom log format
    --dumpExceptions BOOL     Dump exceptions to stderr
    --showErrorMessage BOOL   Show exception message in response (recommended for development only)
    --showErrorStack BOOL     Show exception stack trace (recommended for development only)
    --methodOverrideKey STR   Override the default method key of "_method"
    --sassRoot PATH           Public sass conversion root path
    --staticRoot PATH         Public static file root path

## Middleware

Connect middleware is divided into two concepts. First we have _filters_ which perform an action and allow lower middleware to respond to the request, secondly we have _providers_ which are conceptual "end-points", responding to the request without continuing down the stack.

## Middleware Usage

Below is an example which shows usage of the _log_ filter bundled with Connect, as well as the _static_ provider.

The keys `filter` and `provider` are used only as short-cuts to bundled middleware, to utilize a custom module we can assign a module's exports to the `module` key.

    module.exports = require('./lib/connect').createServer([
        { filter: 'log' },
        { module: require('path/to/custom/middleware') },
        { provider: 'static', root: __dirname + '/public' }
    ]);

As shown above the module exports a `connect.Server` and does not call the `listen()` method directly. This allows other modules to "mount" this app, as well as allowing the _connect_ executable to control how the server is run.
 
If you prefer not to use _connect_, you can simply create a script executable by _node_, `require()` the app, then invoke `listen()`.

    #!/usr/bin/env node
    require('./app').listen();

## Middleware Authoring

Middleware is essentially just an object, responding to a `handle()` method, the example below illustrates how simple it is to create, and utilize custom middleware.
 
First we define the `handle()` method, which accepts three arguments, _req_, _res_, and _next_. 

    var helloWorld = {
        handle: function(req, res, next){
            res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type: 'text/plain' });
            res.end('Hello World');
        }
    };

    require('connect').createServer([
        { module: helloWorld }
    ]);

The `next()` function passes control to the next middleware layer in the stack, and may optionally be passed an instanceof `Error`, at which time only `handleError()` methods may respond.
 
If you wish to pass an exception down the stack, you can invoke `next()` like below:
 
     if (someRequirementIsNotMet) {
         next(new Error('my requirement was not met!'));
     }

We can take this example further by "exporting" the `handle()` method, so that other libraries can simply `require('hello-world')`:
 
    # hello-world.js
    exports.handle = function(req, res, next){
        res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type: 'text/plain' });
        res.end('Hello World');
    };
    
    # app.js
    require('connect').createServer([
        { module: require('./hello-world') }
    ]);

### Exception Handling

If an exception was thrown, or is passed to `next()`, middleware may define the `handleError()` method
in order to respond (or ignore) the exception. The `handleError()` method follows the same semantics as
`handle()`, for example:

    exports.handleError = function(err, req, res, next){
        // At any time we can call next() without
        // any arguments to eliminate exceptional status and
        // continue down the stack

        if (err.code === process.ENOENT) {
            // We dont want to deal with missing files
            // so pass the exception
            next(err);
        } else {
            // Respond with a message
            res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' })
            res.end('shit! im broken');
        }
    };

### Setup Configuration

Connect also supports the `setup()` method, which is called when the middleware is stacked,
and is passed the environment. For example lets say we want our _log_ middleware to support
a custom format, we might define `setup()` as shown below:

    var log = {};

    log.setup = function(env) {
		this.format = this.format || 'our default format';
	}

Allowing developers to pass a custom format when stacked:

	connect.createServer([
		{ module: log, format: 'custom log format' }
	]);

In some cases we may want to support changes through the environment as well. For example
we may want to support `connect --logFormat "super cool format"`, to do all we need to do
is check for `env.logFormat` as shown below. The precedence given is up to you, however
the env is recommended.

	log.setup = function(env) {
		this.format = env.logFormat || this.format || 'our default format';
	}

## Bundled Middleware
